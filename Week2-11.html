          <h1 class="page-title"> Week 1 and 2</h1>
          <p>
             Those first week were mainly about getting familiar with the basics and HTML. However for starters I learned how to use HTML to structure a basic webpage and the various <strong>elements</strong> used within HTML 5 structure for example:
         <ol class = "a">
            
             <li>Title elements</li>
             <li>meta elements</li>
             <li>text header elements</li>
             <li>image element</li>
             <li>divider element</li>
             <li>text span element</li>
             <li>paragrah element</li>
         </ol>
         Each element has a different set of attributes. 
         
          <h1> Week 3</h1>
          <p class="da">
          Week three is when i started to learn how to and when to code the elements. I learned that you use div tags only when HTML5 senimatics don't apply, and to use the <strong>span</strong> tag when tags for idenitifying content does not apply. More infomation about coding <strong>links,list and images</strong> since those are used the most  when it comes to starting to develop a responsive webpage
          </p>
           <h1> Week 4</h1>
          <p class="da">
Week Four was more focused on CSS. That stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS provides an easy way to control the layout and overrall presentation of a webppage. Css seperated the content from the design. During week four i learned of the three way to add CSS to a web page.
         <ol>
             <li> external style sheet</li>
             <li>embedded styles </li>
             <li>inline styles</li>
         </ol>
           <h1> Week 5</h1>
          <p class="da">
          Week 5 was a bit tougher we started to get more invested into CSS. By this i mean we learned to use the CSS box model for page layout such as spacing, background, and borders. These basic properties are used to control the spacing between elements.   

          </p>
           <h1> Week 6 and 7 </h1>
          <p class="da">
Weeks 6 and 7 touched base on the componets of a <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>. Responsive Web Design is important because it gives a webpage the ability to adjust to smaller screens. This includes tablets and other moble devices. I learned that fluid layout is used to adjust the width of a webpage. Also media queries adjusts the appearance of the webpage based on the device. Although i don't quiet understand media queries to well it makes sense on why it is used. The last component to Responsive Web Design is including scalabe images. I made sure to take note of this becuase no one wants a webpage where the images don't scale down to size to adjust the device being used. 
          </p>
           <h1> Week 8 and 9</h1>
          <p class="da">
I considered Weeks 8 and 9 to be both fun and challenging at the same time. I say it was fun because i discovered that you can use html to create forms
Forms. I completed an assignment where i got to work with the code in creating a simple form within HTML. The challenging partis when javascript was introduced. Although it was easy inputting java using the script tag
I found it hard to code when it came to inputting the code into an external js file. The video crash course assignments were helpful when it came to explaining why you were to do something a certain way.
           <h1> Week 10 and 11</h1>
          <p class="da">
            Week 10 and 11 happened to be a bit more challenging because we just went deeper in the language of java
